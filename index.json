	"content": "Contribution guide The netZoo is an open-source software suite of network biology methods in R, Python, MATLAB, and C. Contributions to the netZoo can be in the form of 1) bug fixing, 2) performance improvment, and 3) new functions.\nEach language repository has a master and a devel branch. The master branch contains the stable code of the netZoo, and the devel branch contains the code with the new features that gets periodically merged into the master branch. New contributions of type 1) and 2) have to go through automatic tests before being integrated into the package. Contributions of type 3) have to be submitted with unit tests and tutorials to explain how the new function works.\nThe contribution model follows the standard fork-branch model on the devel branch. Contributions are submitted as pull requests (PRs).\n  fork the netZoo repo to your github\n  clone the forked repo to your computer\ngit clone https://github.com/\u0026lt;your_github_name\u0026gt;/netZoo{R,Py,M,C}.git\n  access netZoo local folder cd netZoo{R,Py,M,C}\n  add a new remote typically called \u0026lsquo;upstream\u0026rsquo; that points to the source of netZoo\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/netZoo/netZoo{R,Py,M,C}.git\n  switch to the devel branch, because your PR will target the devel branch\ngit checkout devel\n  create a new branch called new-feature off of the devel branch\ngit checkout -b new-feature\n  make the changes/additions to netZoo\n  add your changes\ngit add .\n  commit your changes\ngit commit -m 'commit message'\n  push your PR\ngit push origin new-feature\n  go the netZoo website https://github.com/netZoo/netZoo{R, Py, M, C}\n  create a pull request through the pop-up\n  make sure to change the target to devel branch not the master branch\n  the PR will go through automatic tests and it will be accepted by the moderators if it passes the tests\n  if the PR does not pass the test, further changes need to be made (step 8-10)\n  once the PR integrated in the devel branch, you can delete new-feature, switch back to devel branch and update it with the new branch through\ngit checkout devel\ngit fetch upstream\ngit merge upstream/devel\n  you can do the same for the master branch to update it .\n  Delete the merged feature branch both locally and remotely.\n "

	"description": "",
	"content": "Installation guide To install netZoo{Py, M, C}, all you have to do is git clone https://github.com/netZoo/netZoo{Py,M,C}.git then to get the latest changes in your repository you need to git pull origin master.\nYou can work on the devel branch by git checkout devel. To update the devel branch type git pull origin devel.\nIn Python, an additional step is required to install netZooPy through pip3 install -e . in the either the root of devel or master branch and after each change to the source code.\nIn R, the installation does not require git clone, the devtools library allow to install netZooR directly from github and from either devel or master.\nPlease refer to the specific installation guide for each package for more details.\nQuick developer guide If you are a developer, you will need to clone to your own fork to be able to create pull requests to netZoo. Please refer to the contribution guide.\nMake sure to have the latest changes in your local repo through git fetch upstream then git merge upstream/master.\nTo update the devel branch git checkout devel and git fetch upstream and git merge upstream/devel.\nMake sure to update your repository before creating a pull request or creating an issue.\n "

	"content": "The network zoo netZoo{R,Py,M,C} is a network biology package for the reconstruction and analysis of gene regulatory networks.\nPackages R:  netZooR  Python:  netZooPy  MATLAB:  netZooM  C:  netZooC  Starting from netZooM 0.4.1, netZooPy 0.5.1, and netZooR 0.6.1 (which includes pandaR 1.19.4), the default data processing step in PANDA has changed. Data processing was modified in all platforms to give the same output as PANDA in netZooC, which adds rows of zeros if a gene/TF is missing in at least one prior (expression, motif, ppi). The previous behavior can be accessed through the \u0026lsquo;legacy\u0026rsquo; option in the variable mode. The option \u0026lsquo;intersection\u0026rsquo; of the variable mode removes missing TFs/genes if they are absent from at least one prior.\n Live status R - build status (Macos) - coverage\nPython - build status (Ubuntu) - coverage\nMATLAB - build status (Ubuntu, Macos) - coverage\nC - build status (Ubuntu, Macos) - coverage\nnetZoo{R,Py,M,C} is a community maintained package licensed under GPL-3.0.\n "
