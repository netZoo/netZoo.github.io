	"content": "Contribution guide The netZoo is an open-source software suite of network biology methods in R, Python, MATLAB, and C. Contributions to the netZoo can be in the form of 1) bug fixing, 2) performance improvment, and 3) new functions.\nEach language repository has a master and a devel branch. The master branch contains the stable code of the netZoo, and the devel branch contains the code with the new features that gets periodically merged into the master branch. New contributions of type 1) and 2) have to go through automatic tests before being integrated into the package. Contributions of type 3) have to be submitted with unit tests and tutorials to explain how the new function works.\nPreparing the contribution To increase the chances of including a contribution to netZoo, please follow the instructions below.\nNew functions New functions have to include a header that will server as documentation. Headers include a general description, description of inputs, ouputs, any notes, the authors list, the date, and a reference to the publication. Please follow this example.\nTo add a unit test, please include all the edge cases and the expected behavior of the function and ground truth dataset to test against. The tests should run ideally on several small examples to test several edge cases in a limited runtime. If a function is submitted in more than one language or if the function is a new implementation of a function that already exists in another language, there should be only one ground truth dataset across platform. This will ensure that the behavior of the function is the same across platforms. For example, if you're contirbuting a MATLAB implementation of PANDA, and there is an R implementation of PANDA, you should use the ground truth from netZooR for your test. Please check the tests folder of each repo for examples.\nPlease update your repo and make sure the tests pass locally before creating a PR. In R, please refer to the netZooR contribution guide. In Python, please run pytest in the root of netZooPy. In Matlab, you can run the tests in the tests folder manually.\n Bug fixes To fix a bug in a function, please create a new pull request with a description of the fix, and a new ground truth dataset if this relevant for the unit test.\nPerformance improvement To improve the speed/memory usage of a function, please create a new pull request with a description of the addition and its impact on memory/speed.\nPull requests to netZoo The contribution model follows the standard fork-branch model on the devel branch. Contributions are submitted as pull requests (PRs).\n  fork the netZoo repo to your github\n  clone the forked repo to your computer\ngit clone https://github.com/\u0026lt;your_github_name\u0026gt;/netZoo{R,Py,M,C}.git\n  access netZoo local folder cd netZoo{R,Py,M,C}\n  add a new remote typically called \u0026lsquo;upstream\u0026rsquo; that points to the source of netZoo\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/netZoo/netZoo{R,Py,M,C}.git\n  switch to the devel branch, because your PR will target the devel branch\ngit checkout devel\n  create a new branch called new-feature off of the devel branch\ngit checkout -b new-feature\n  make the changes/additions to netZoo\n  add your changes\ngit add .\n  commit your changes\ngit commit -m 'commit message'\n  push your PR\ngit push origin new-feature\n  go the netZoo website https://github.com/netZoo/netZoo{R, Py, M, C}\n  create a pull request through the pop-up\n  make sure to change the target to devel branch not the master branch\n  the PR will go through automatic tests and it will be accepted by the moderators if it passes the tests\n  if the PR does not pass the test, further changes need to be made (step 8-10)\n  once the PR integrated in the devel branch, you can delete new-feature, switch back to devel branch and update it with the new branch through\ngit checkout devel\ngit fetch upstream\ngit merge upstream/devel\n  you can do the same for the master branch to update it .\n  Delete the merged feature branch both locally and remotely.\n "

	"content": "Installation guide To install netZoo{Py, M, C}, all you have to do is git clone https://github.com/netZoo/netZoo{Py,M,C}.git then to get the latest changes in your repository you need to git pull origin master.\nYou can work on the devel branch by git checkout devel. To update the devel branch type git pull origin devel.\nIn Python, an additional step is required to install netZooPy through pip3 install -e . in the either the root of devel or master branch and after each change to the source code.\nIn R, the installation does not require git clone, the devtools library allow to install netZooR directly from github and from either devel or master.\nPlease refer to the specific installation guide for each package for more details.\nQuick developer guide If you are a developer, you will need to clone to your own fork to be able to create pull requests to netZoo. Please refer to the contribution guide.\nMake sure to have the latest changes in your local repo through git fetch upstream then git merge upstream/master.\nTo update the devel branch git checkout devel and git fetch upstream and git merge upstream/devel.\nMake sure to update your repository before creating a pull request or creating an issue.\n "

	"content": "Reference Passing Messages between Biological Networks to Refine Predicted Interactions. link.\nAbstract Regulatory network reconstruction is a fundamental problem in computational biology. There are significant limitations to such reconstruction using individual datasets, and increasingly people attempt to construct networks using multiple, independent datasets obtained from complementary sources, but methods for this integration are lacking. We developed PANDA (Passing Attributes between Networks for Data Assimilation), a message-passing model using multiple sources of information to predict regulatory relationships, and used it to integrate protein-protein interaction, gene expression, and sequence motif data to reconstruct genome-wide, condition-specific regulatory networks in yeast as a model. The resulting networks were not only more accurate than those produced using individual data sets and other existing methods, but they also captured information regarding specific biological mechanisms and pathways that were missed using other methodologies. PANDA is scalable to higher eukaryotes, applicable to specific tissue or cell type data and conceptually generalizable to include a variety of regulatory, interaction, expression, and other genome-scale data. An implementation of the PANDA algorithm is available at www.sourceforge.net/projects/panda-net.\nImplementation netZooR, netZooPy, netZooM, netZooC\n"

Data processing was modified in all platforms to give the same output as PANDA in netZooC, which adds rows of zeros if a gene/TF is missing in at least one prior (expression, motif, ppi). The previous behavior can be accessed through the \u0026lsquo;legacy\u0026rsquo; option in the variable mode. The option \u0026lsquo;intersection\u0026rsquo; of the variable mode removes missing TFs/genes if they are absent from at least one prior.\n Live status Continuous integration is enabled for netZoo using Travis and ZooKeeper.\nR - build status (Ubuntu) - coverage\nPython - build status (Ubuntu, Macos) - coverage\nMATLAB - build status (Ubuntu, Macos) - coverage\nC - build status (Ubuntu, Macos) - coverage\nnetZoo{R,Py,M,C} is a community maintained package licensed under GPL-3.0.\n "

	"content": "Reference Estimating Sample-Specific Regulatory Networks. link.\nAbstract Biological systems are driven by intricate interactions among molecules. Many methods have been developed that draw on large numbers of expression samples to infer connections between genes (or their products). The result is an aggregate network representing a single estimate for the likelihood of each interaction, or “edge,” in the network. Although informative, aggregate models fail to capture population heterogeneity. Here we propose a method to reverse engineer sample-specific networks from aggregate networks. We demonstrate our approach in several contexts, including simulated, yeast microarray, and human lymphoblastoid cell line RNA sequencing data. We use these sample-specific networks to study changes in network topology across time and to characterize shifts in gene regulation that were not apparent in the expression data. We believe that generating sample-specific networks will greatly facilitate the application of network methods to large, complex, and heterogeneous multi-omic datasets, supporting the emerging field of precision network medicine.\nImplementation netZooR, netZooPy, netZooM\n"
