      <description>Reference Passing Messages between Biological Networks to Refine Predicted Interactions. link.
Abstract Regulatory network reconstruction is a fundamental problem in computational biology. There are significant limitations to such reconstruction using individual datasets, and increasingly people attempt to construct networks using multiple, independent datasets obtained from complementary sources, but methods for this integration are lacking. We developed PANDA (Passing Attributes between Networks for Data Assimilation), a message-passing model using multiple sources of information to predict regulatory relationships, and used it to integrate protein-protein interaction, gene expression, and sequence motif data to reconstruct genome-wide, condition-specific regulatory networks in yeast as a model.</description>

      <description>Reference Estimating Sample-Specific Regulatory Networks. link.
Abstract Biological systems are driven by intricate interactions among molecules. Many methods have been developed that draw on large numbers of expression samples to infer connections between genes (or their products). The result is an aggregate network representing a single estimate for the likelihood of each interaction, or “edge,” in the network. Although informative, aggregate models fail to capture population heterogeneity. Here we propose a method to reverse engineer sample-specific networks from aggregate networks.</description>

      <description>Reference Bipartite Community Structure of eQTLs. link.
Abstract Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses have identified genetic associations with a wide range of human phenotypes. However, many of these variants have weak effects and understanding their combined effect remains a challenge. One hypothesis is that multiple SNPs interact in complex networks to influence functional processes that ultimately lead to complex phenotypes, including disease states.</description>

      <description>Reference Estimating drivers of cell state transitions using gene regulatory network models. link.
Abstract Background: Specific cellular states are often associated with distinct gene expression patterns. These states are plastic, changing during development, or in the transition from health to disease. One relatively simple extension of this concept is to recognize that we can classify different cell-types by their active gene regulatory networks and that, consequently, transitions between cellular states can be modeled by changes in these underlying regulatory networks.</description>

      <description>Reference Detecting phenotype-driven transitions in regulatory network structure. link.
Abstract Complex traits and diseases like human height or cancer are often not caused by a single mutation or genetic variant, but instead arise from functional changes in the underlying molecular network. Biological networks are known to be highly modular and contain dense “communities” of genes that carry out cellular processes, but these structures change between tissues, during development, and in disease.</description>

      <description>Reference PUMA: PANDA Using MicroRNA Associations. link.
Abstract Conventional methods to analyze genomic data do not make use of the interplay between multiple factors, such as between microRNAs (miRNAs) and the mRNA transcripts they regulate, and thereby often fail to identify the cellular processes that are unique to specific tissues. We developed PUMA (PANDA Using MicroRNA Associations), a computational tool that uses message passing to integrate a prior network of miRNA target predictions with target gene co-expression information to model genome-wide gene regulation by miRNAs.</description>

      <description>Reference Cancer subtype identification using somatic mutation data. link.
Abstract Background: With the onset of next-generation sequencing technologies, we have made great progress in identifying recurrent mutational drivers of cancer. As cancer tissues are now frequently screened for specific sets of mutations, a large amount of samples has become available for analysis. Classification of patients with similar mutation profiles may help identifying subgroups of patients who might benefit from specific types of treatment.</description>

      <description>Reference Gene Regulatory Network Inference as Relaxed Graph Matching. link.
Abstract Gene regulatory network inference is instrumental to the discovery of genetic mechanisms driving diverse diseases, including cancer. Here, we present a theoretical framework for PANDA, an established method for gene regulatory network inference. PANDA is based on iterative message passing updates that resemble the gradient descent of an optimization problem, OTTER, which can be interpreted as relaxed inexact graph matching between a gene-gene co-expression and a protein-protein interaction matrix.</description>
