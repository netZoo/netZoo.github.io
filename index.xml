      <description>Contribution guide The netZoo is an open-source software suite of network biology methods in R, Python, MATLAB, and C. Contributions to the netZoo can be in the form of 1) bug fixing, 2) performance improvment, and 3) new functions.
Each language repository has a master and a devel branch. The master branch contains the stable code of the netZoo, and the devel branch contains the code with the new features that gets periodically merged into the master branch.</description>

      <description>Reference Passing Messages between Biological Networks to Refine Predicted Interactions.

Plos One
doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0064832.
Abstract Regulatory network reconstruction is a fundamental problem in computational biology. There are significant limitations to such reconstruction using individual datasets, and increasingly people attempt to construct networks using multiple, independent datasets obtained from complementary sources, but methods for this integration are lacking. We developed PANDA (Passing Attributes between Networks for Data Assimilation), a message-passing model using multiple sources of information to predict regulatory relationships, and used it to integrate protein-protein interaction, gene expression, and sequence motif data to reconstruct genome-wide, condition-specific regulatory networks in yeast as a model.</description>

iScience
doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2019.03.021.
Abstract Biological systems are driven by intricate interactions among molecules. Many methods have been developed that draw on large numbers of expression samples to infer connections between genes (or their products). The result is an aggregate network representing a single estimate for the likelihood of each interaction, or “edge,” in the network.</description>

Plos computational biology
doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005033.
Abstract Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses have identified genetic associations with a wide range of human phenotypes. However, many of these variants have weak effects and understanding their combined effect remains a challenge. One hypothesis is that multiple SNPs interact in complex networks to influence functional processes that ultimately lead to complex phenotypes, including disease states.</description>

BMC Systems Biology
doi.org/10.1186/s12918-017-0517-y.
Abstract Background: Specific cellular states are often associated with distinct gene expression patterns. These states are plastic, changing during development, or in the transition from health to disease. One relatively simple extension of this concept is to recognize that we can classify different cell-types by their active gene regulatory networks and that, consequently, transitions between cellular states can be modeled by changes in these underlying regulatory networks.</description>

Abstract Complex traits and diseases like human height or cancer are often not caused by a single mutation or genetic variant, but instead arise from functional changes in the underlying molecular network. Biological networks are known to be highly modular and contain dense “communities” of genes that carry out cellular processes, but these structures change between tissues, during development, and in disease.</description>

Marieke L Kuijjer, Maud Fagny, Alessandro Marin, John Quackenbush, Kimberly Glass.
OUP Bioinformatics
doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa571.
Abstract Conventional methods to analyze genomic data do not make use of the interplay between multiple factors, such as between microRNAs (miRNAs) and the mRNA transcripts they regulate, and thereby often fail to identify the cellular processes that are unique to specific tissues. We developed PUMA (PANDA Using MicroRNA Associations), a computational tool that uses message passing to integrate a prior network of miRNA target predictions with target gene co-expression information to model genome-wide gene regulation by miRNAs.</description>

Abstract Background: With the onset of next-generation sequencing technologies, we have made great progress in identifying recurrent mutational drivers of cancer. As cancer tissues are now frequently screened for specific sets of mutations, a large amount of samples has become available for analysis.</description>

doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.23.167999.
Abstract Gene regulatory network inference is instrumental to the discovery of genetic mechanisms driving diverse diseases, including cancer. Here, we present a theoretical framework for PANDA, an established method for gene regulatory network inference. PANDA is based on iterative message passing updates that resemble the gradient descent of an optimization problem, OTTER, which can be interpreted as relaxed inexact graph matching between a gene-gene co-expression and a protein-protein interaction matrix.</description>

Abstract The use of biological networks such as protein-protein interaction and transcriptional regulatory networks is becoming an integral part of biological research in the genomics era. However, these networks are not static, and during phenotypic transitions like disease onset, they can acquire new “communities” of genes that carry out key cellular processes.</description>

Abhijeet Rajendra Sonawane, Dawn L. DeMeo, John Quackenbush, Kimberly Glass.
bioRxiv
doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.19.345827.
Abstract The biological processes that drive cellular function can be represented by a complex network of interactions between regulators (transcription factors) and their targets (genes). A cell’s epigenetic state plays an important role in mediating these interactions, primarily by influencing chromatin accessibility. However, effectively leveraging epigenetic information when constructing regulatory networks remains a challenge.</description>

Abstract Gene regulatory network inference allows the study of transcriptional control to identify the alteration of cellular processes in human diseases. The computational inference of gene regulation using PANDA, PUMA, and SPIDER for aggregate networks and LIONESS, which models single-sample networks involves the assessment of several lines of biological evidence. These tools use the same PANDA computational backend, in particular, they perform operations on large data matrices, which limits their use for large-scale genomic studies due to the computational burden.</description>

doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.18.427134
Abstract The majority of disease-associated genetic variants are thought to have regulatory effects, including the disruption of transcription factor (TF) binding and the alteration of downstream gene expression. Identifying how a person’s genotype affects their individual gene regulatory network has the potential to provide important insights into disease etiology and to enable improved genotype-specific disease risk assessments and treatments.</description>
