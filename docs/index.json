	"content": "Contribution guide The netZoo is an open-source software suite of network biology methods in R, Python, MATLAB, and C. Contributions to the netZoo can be in the form of 1) bug fixing, 2) performance improvment, and 3) new functions.\nEach language repository has a master and a devel branch. The master branch contains the stable code of the netZoo, and the devel branch contains the code with the new features that gets periodically merged into the master branch. New contributions of type 1) and 2) have to go through automatic tests before being integrated into the package. Contributions of type 3) have to be submitted with unit tests and tutorials to explain how the new function works.\nPreparing the contribution If you are new to GitHub, check our Git tutorial to learn about basic commands. Then, to increase the chances of including a contribution to netZoo, please follow the instructions for the contribution model below.\nNew functions New functions have to include a header that will server as documentation. Headers include a general description, description of inputs, ouputs, any notes, the authors list, the date, and a reference to the publication. Please follow this example.\nTo add a unit test, please include all the edge cases and the expected behavior of the function and ground truth dataset to test against. The tests should run ideally on several small examples to test several edge cases in a limited runtime. If a function is submitted in more than one language or if the function is a new implementation of a function that already exists in another language, there should be only one ground truth dataset across platform. This will ensure that the behavior of the function is the same across platforms. For example, if you're contirbuting a MATLAB implementation of PANDA, and there is an R implementation of PANDA, you should use the ground truth from netZooR for your test. Please check the tests folder of each repo for examples.\nPlease update your repo and make sure the tests pass locally before creating a PR. In R, please refer to the netZooR contribution guide. In Python, please run pytest in the root of netZooPy. In Matlab, you can run the tests in the tests folder manually.\n Bug fixes To fix a bug in a function, please create a new pull request with a description of the fix, and a new ground truth dataset if this relevant for the unit test.\nPerformance improvement To improve the speed/memory usage of a function, please create a new pull request with a description of the addition and its impact on memory/speed.\nPull requests to netZoo The contribution model follows the standard fork-branch model on the devel branch. Contributions are submitted as pull requests (PRs).\n  fork the netZoo repo to your github\n  clone the forked repo to your computer\ngit clone https://github.com/\u0026lt;your_github_name\u0026gt;/netZoo{R,Py,M,C}.git\n  access netZoo local folder cd netZoo{R,Py,M,C}\n  add a new remote typically called \u0026lsquo;upstream\u0026rsquo; that points to the source of netZoo\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/netZoo/netZoo{R,Py,M,C}.git\n  switch to the devel branch, because your PR will target the devel branch\ngit checkout devel\n  create a new branch called new-feature off of the devel branch\ngit checkout -b new-feature\n  make the changes/additions to netZoo\n  add your changes\ngit add .\n  commit your changes\ngit commit -m 'commit message'\n  push your PR\ngit push origin new-feature\n  go the netZoo website https://github.com/netZoo/netZoo{R, Py, M, C}\n  create a pull request through the pop-up\n  make sure to change the target to devel branch not the master branch\n  the PR will go through automatic tests and it will be accepted by the moderators if it passes the tests\n  If more than one commit are made in the same PR, then it is strongly recommended to \u0026lsquo;squash\u0026rsquo; them into a single commit\n  if the PR does not pass the test, further changes need to be made (step 8-10)\n  once the PR integrated in the devel branch, you can delete new-feature, switch back to devel branch and update it with the new branch through\ngit checkout devel\ngit fetch upstream\ngit merge upstream/devel\n  you can do the same for the master branch to update it .\n  Delete the merged feature branch both locally and remotely.\n "

There are significant limitations to such reconstruction using individual datasets, and increasingly people attempt to construct networks using multiple, independent datasets obtained from complementary sources, but methods for this integration are lacking. We developed PANDA (Passing Attributes between Networks for Data Assimilation), a message-passing model using multiple sources of information to predict regulatory relationships, and used it to integrate protein-protein interaction, gene expression, and sequence motif data to reconstruct genome-wide, condition-specific regulatory networks in yeast as a model. The resulting networks were not only more accurate than those produced using individual data sets and other existing methods, but they also captured information regarding specific biological mechanisms and pathways that were missed using other methodologies. PANDA is scalable to higher eukaryotes, applicable to specific tissue or cell type data and conceptually generalizable to include a variety of regulatory, interaction, expression, and other genome-scale data. An implementation of the PANDA algorithm is available at www.sourceforge.net/projects/panda-net.\nImplementation netZooR, netZooPy, netZooM, netZooC\nNetbook tutorials The following netbooks use PANDA:\n  netZooR:\n  Building PANDA and LIONESS Regulatory Networks from GTEx Gene Expression Data in R\n  Building PANDA Regulatory Networks from GTEx Gene Expression Data in R\n  Finding drug candidates to reverse Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD)-induced gene regulation disruption using TCGA\n  Differential gene targeting of pancreatic cancer subtypes\n  Sex differences in lung adenocarcinoma\n  Generating 26 cancer gene regulatory network using TCGA datasets\n  Building and analyzing enhancer-driven TF-gene regulatory networks PANDA and LIONESS\n    netZooPy:\n  Controlling the variance of PANDA networks\n  Benchmarking motif networks for the reconstruction of kidney cancer regulatory network\n    "

Many methods have been developed that draw on large numbers of expression samples to infer connections between genes (or their products). The result is an aggregate network representing a single estimate for the likelihood of each interaction, or “edge,” in the network. Although informative, aggregate models fail to capture population heterogeneity. Here we propose a method to reverse engineer sample-specific networks from aggregate networks. We demonstrate our approach in several contexts, including simulated, yeast microarray, and human lymphoblastoid cell line RNA sequencing data. We use these sample-specific networks to study changes in network topology across time and to characterize shifts in gene regulation that were not apparent in the expression data.

Castaldi, Dawn DeMeo, John Quackenbush.\nPlos computational biology\ndoi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005033.\nAbstract Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses have identified genetic associations with a wide range of human phenotypes. However, many of these variants have weak effects and understanding their combined effect remains a challenge. One hypothesis is that multiple SNPs interact in complex networks to influence functional processes that ultimately lead to complex phenotypes, including disease states. Here we present CONDOR, a method that represents both cis- and trans-acting SNPs and the genes with which they are associated as a bipartite graph and then uses the modular structure of that graph to place SNPs into a functional context. In applying CONDOR to eQTLs in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), we found the global network \u0026ldquo;hub\u0026rdquo; SNPs were devoid of disease associations through GWAS. However, the network was organized into 52 communities of SNPs and genes, many of which were enriched for genes in specific functional classes. We identified local hubs within each community (\u0026ldquo;core SNPs\u0026rdquo;) and these were enriched for GWAS SNPs for COPD and many other diseases. These results speak to our intuition: rather than single SNPs influencing single genes, we see groups of SNPs associated with the expression of families of functionally related genes and that disease SNPs are associated with the perturbation of those functions. These methods are not limited in their application to COPD and can be used in the analysis of a wide variety of disease processes and other phenotypic traits.\nImplementation netZooR, netZooPy\nNetbook tutorials The following netbooks use CONDOR:\n  netZooR:\n  Exploring eQTL tissue regulation with CONDOR\n  Building and analyzing enhancer-driven TF-gene regulatory networks PANDA and LIONESS\n    netZooPy:\n Benchmarking motif networks for the reconstruction of kidney cancer regulatory network    "

These states are plastic, changing during development, or in the transition from health to disease. One relatively simple extension of this concept is to recognize that we can classify different cell-types by their active gene regulatory networks and that, consequently, transitions between cellular states can be modeled by changes in these underlying regulatory networks.\nResults: Here we describe MONSTER, MOdeling Network State Transitions from Expression and Regulatory data, a regression-based method for inferring transcription factor drivers of cell state conditions at the gene regulatory network level. As a demonstration, we apply MONSTER to four different studies of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to identify transcription factors that alter the network structure as the cell state progresses toward the disease-state.\nConclusions: We demonstrate that MONSTER can find strong regulatory signals that persist across studies and tissues of the same disease and that are not detectable using conventional analysis methods based on differential expression.

Biological networks are known to be highly modular and contain dense “communities” of genes that carry out cellular processes, but these structures change between tissues, during development, and in disease. While many methods exist for inferring networks and analyzing their topologies separately, there is a lack of robust methods for quantifying differences in network structure. Here, we describe ALPACA (ALtered Partitions Across Community Architectures), a method for comparing two genome-scale networks derived from different phenotypic states to identify condition-specific modules. In simulations, ALPACA leads to more nuanced, sensitive, and robust module discovery than currently available network comparison methods. As an application, we use ALPACA to compare transcriptional networks in three contexts: angiogenic and non-angiogenic subtypes of ovarian cancer, human fibroblasts expressing transforming viral oncogenes, and sexual dimorphism in human breast tissue. In each case, ALPACA identifies modules enriched for processes relevant to the phenotype. For example, modules specific to angiogenic ovarian tumors are enriched for genes associated with blood vessel development, and modules found in female breast tissue are enriched for genes involved in estrogen receptor and ERK signaling. The functional relevance of these new modules suggests that not only can ALPACA identify structural changes in complex networks, but also that these changes may be relevant for characterizing biological phenotypes.\nImplementation netZooR\nNetbook tutorials The following netbooks use ALPACA:\n  netZooR:\n  Gene regulatory network analysis in Glioblastoma\n  Building and analyzing enhancer-driven TF-gene regulatory networks PANDA and LIONESS\n    "

We developed PUMA (PANDA Using MicroRNA Associations), a computational tool that uses message passing to integrate a prior network of miRNA target predictions with target gene co-expression information to model genome-wide gene regulation by miRNAs. We applied PUMA to 38 tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, integrating RNA-Seq data with two different miRNA target predictions priors, built on predictions from TargetScan and miRanda, respectively. We found that while target predictions obtained from these two different resources are considerably different, PUMA captures similar tissue-specific miRNA-target regulatory interactions in the different network models. Furthermore, the tissue-specific functions of miRNAs we identified based on regulatory profiles (available at: https://kuijjer.shinyapps.io/puma_gtex/) are highly similar between networks modeled on the two target prediction resources. This indicates that PUMA consistently captures important tissue-specific miRNA regulatory processes. In addition, using PUMA we identified miRNAs regulating important tissue-specific processes that, when mutated, may result in disease development in the same tissue.

As cancer tissues are now frequently screened for specific sets of mutations, a large amount of samples has become available for analysis. Classification of patients with similar mutation profiles may help identifying subgroups of patients who might benefit from specific types of treatment. However, classification based on somatic mutations is challenging due to the sparseness and heterogeneity of the data.\nMethods: Here we describe a new method to de-sparsify somatic mutation data using biological pathways. We applied this method to 23 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas, including samples from 5805 primary tumours.\nResults: We show that, for most cancer types, de-sparsified mutation data associate with phenotypic data. We identify poor prognostic subtypes in three cancer types, which are associated with mutations in signal transduction pathways for which targeted treatment options are available. We identify subtype–drug associations for 14 additional subtypes.

The solutions of OTTER can be derived explicitly and inspire an alternative spectral algorithm, for which we can provide network recovery guarantees. We compare different solution approaches of OTTER to other inference methods using three biological data sets, which we make publicly available to offer a new application venue for relaxed graph matching in gene regulatory network inference. We find that using modern gradient descent methods with superior convergence properties solving OTTER outperforms state-of-the-art gene regulatory network inference methods in predicting binding of transcription factors to regulatory regions.\nSupplementary data Several OTTER networks are available in GRAND database.

Grant, Megha Padi.\nFrontiers in Genetics\ndoi.org/10.3389/fgene.2020.603264.\nAbstract The use of biological networks such as protein-protein interaction and transcriptional regulatory networks is becoming an integral part of biological research in the genomics era. However, these networks are not static, and during phenotypic transitions like disease onset, they can acquire new “communities” of genes that carry out key cellular processes. Changes in community structure can be detected by maximizing a modularity-based score, but because biological systems and network inference algorithms are inherently noisy, it remains a challenge to determine whether these changes represent real cellular responses or whether they appeared by random chance. Here, we introduce Constrained Random Alteration of Network Edges (CRANE), a computational method that samples networks with fixed node strengths to identify a null distribution and assess the robustness of observed changes in network structure. In contrast with other approaches, such as consensus clustering or established network generative models, CRANE produces more biologically realistic results and performs better in simulations. When applied to breast and ovarian cancer networks, CRANE improves the recovery of cancer-relevant GO terms while reducing the signal from non-specific housekeeping processes. CRANE is a general tool that can be applied in tandem with a variety of stochastic community detection methods to evaluate the veracity of their results.\nImplementation netZooR\n"

DeMeo, John Quackenbush, Kimberly Glass.\nbioRxiv\ndoi.org/10.1101/2020.10.19.345827.\nAbstract The biological processes that drive cellular function can be represented by a complex network of interactions between regulators (transcription factors) and their targets (genes). A cell’s epigenetic state plays an important role in mediating these interactions, primarily by influencing chromatin accessibility. However, effectively leveraging epigenetic information when constructing regulatory networks remains a challenge. We developed SPIDER, which incorporates epigenetic information (DNase-Seq) into a message passing framework in order to estimate gene regulatory networks. We validated SPIDER’s predictions using ChlP-Seq data from ENCODE and found that SPIDER networks were more accurate than other publicly available, epigenetically informed regulatory networks as well as networks based on methods that leverage epigenetic data to predict transcription factor binding sites. SPIDER was also able to improve the detection of cell line specific regulatory interactions. Notably, SPIDER can recover ChlP-seq verified transcription factor binding events in the regulatory regions of genes that do not have a corresponding sequence motif. Constructing biologically interpretable, epigenetically informed networks using SPIDER will allow us to better understand gene regulation as well as aid in the identification of cell-specific drivers and biomarkers of cellular phenotypes.\nImplementation netZooM, netZooR\n"

However, the effects of genetic variants are not typically considered when constructing gene regulatory networks, despite the fact that many disease-associated genetic variants are thought to have regulatory effects, including the disruption of transcription factor (TF) binding. We developed EGRET (Estimating the Genetic Regulatory Effect on TFs), which infers a genotype-specific gene regulatory network for each individual in a study population. EGRET begins by constructing a genotype-informed TF-gene prior network derived using TF motif predictions, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data, individual genotypes, and the predicted effects of genetic variants on TF binding. It then uses a technique known as message passing to integrate this prior network with gene expression and TF protein–protein interaction data to produce a refined, genotype-specific regulatory network. We used EGRET to infer gene regulatory networks for two blood-derived cell lines and identified genotype-associated, cell line–specific regulatory differences that we subsequently validated using allele-specific expression, chromatin accessibility QTLs, and differential ChIP-seq TF binding. We also inferred EGRET networks for three cell types from each of 119 individuals and identified cell type–specific regulatory differences associated with diseases related to those cell types. EGRET is, to our knowledge, the first method that infers networks reflective of individual genetic variation in a way that provides insight into the genetic regulatory associations driving complex phenotypes.\nImplementation netZooR\n"

We further demonstrate in an analysis of joint transcriptome - methylome data from TCGA breast cancer specimens that DRAGON can identify key molecular mechanisms such as gene regulation via promoter methylation.

These complex data sets present significant analytical challenges due to batch and tissue effects, but provide the opportunity to revisit the assumptions and methods that we use to preprocess, normalize, and filter RNA-Seq data – critical first steps for any subsequent analysis.\nResults\nWe find that analysis of large RNA-Seq data sets requires both careful quality control and the need to account for sparsity due to the heterogeneity intrinsic in multi-group studies. We developed Yet Another RNA Normalization software pipeline (YARN), that includes quality control and preprocessing, gene filtering, and normalization steps designed to facilitate downstream analysis of large, heterogeneous RNA-Seq data sets and we demonstrate its use with data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project.\nConclusions\nAn R package instantiating YARN is available at http://bioconductor.org/packages/yarn.\nImplementation netZooR\n"

One of the challenges in understanding transcriptional regulation is that there is no easy way to infer the main regulators from gene expression data. Many existing methods focus on estimating the activity of individual transcription factors (TFs) using static TF-gene interaction databases, but regulomes are often altered in different cell types and disease conditions. To address this problem, we developed a new algorithm – Transcriptional Inference using Gene Expression and Regulatory data (TIGER) – that leverages Bayesian matrix factorization to simultaneously infer TF regulomes and transcription factor (TF) activities from RNA-seq data. We show that, when applied to yeast, A375, and MCF7 TF knock-out datasets, TIGER can provide more accurate predictions than comparable methods. The application to single-cell RNA-seq data reveals TIGER’s potential for uncovering cell differentiation mechanisms. Our results reinforce the importance of incorporating context-specific regulation when studying the mechanisms driving disease in different cell types.\nImplementation netZooR\n"
