      <description>Reference Passing Messages between Biological Networks to Refine Predicted Interactions.
Kimberly Glass, Curtis Huttenhower, John Quackenbush, Guo-Cheng Yuan.
Plos One
doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0064832.
Abstract Regulatory network reconstruction is a fundamental problem in computational biology. There are significant limitations to such reconstruction using individual datasets, and increasingly people attempt to construct networks using multiple, independent datasets obtained from complementary sources, but methods for this integration are lacking. We developed PANDA (Passing Attributes between Networks for Data Assimilation), a message-passing model using multiple sources of information to predict regulatory relationships, and used it to integrate protein-protein interaction, gene expression, and sequence motif data to reconstruct genome-wide, condition-specific regulatory networks in yeast as a model.</description>

iScience
doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2019.03.021.
Abstract Biological systems are driven by intricate interactions among molecules. Many methods have been developed that draw on large numbers of expression samples to infer connections between genes (or their products). The result is an aggregate network representing a single estimate for the likelihood of each interaction, or “edge,” in the network.</description>

      <description>Reference Bipartite Community Structure of eQTLs.

Plos computational biology
doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005033.
Abstract Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses have identified genetic associations with a wide range of human phenotypes. However, many of these variants have weak effects and understanding their combined effect remains a challenge. One hypothesis is that multiple SNPs interact in complex networks to influence functional processes that ultimately lead to complex phenotypes, including disease states.</description>

      <description>Reference Estimating drivers of cell state transitions using gene regulatory network models.
Daniel Schlauch, Kimberly Glass, Craig P Hersh, Edwin K Silverman, John Quackenbush.
BMC Systems Biology
doi.org/10.1186/s12918-017-0517-y.
Abstract Background: Specific cellular states are often associated with distinct gene expression patterns. These states are plastic, changing during development, or in the transition from health to disease. One relatively simple extension of this concept is to recognize that we can classify different cell-types by their active gene regulatory networks and that, consequently, transitions between cellular states can be modeled by changes in these underlying regulatory networks.</description>

doi:10.1038/s41540-018-0052-5.
Abstract Complex traits and diseases like human height or cancer are often not caused by a single mutation or genetic variant, but instead arise from functional changes in the underlying molecular network. Biological networks are known to be highly modular and contain dense “communities” of genes that carry out cellular processes, but these structures change between tissues, during development, and in disease.</description>

      <description>Reference PUMA: PANDA Using MicroRNA Associations.
Marieke L Kuijjer, Maud Fagny, Alessandro Marin, John Quackenbush, Kimberly Glass.
OUP Bioinformatics
doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa571.
Abstract Conventional methods to analyze genomic data do not make use of the interplay between multiple factors, such as between microRNAs (miRNAs) and the mRNA transcripts they regulate, and thereby often fail to identify the cellular processes that are unique to specific tissues. We developed PUMA (PANDA Using MicroRNA Associations), a computational tool that uses message passing to integrate a prior network of miRNA target predictions with target gene co-expression information to model genome-wide gene regulation by miRNAs.</description>

doi.org/10.1038/s41416-018-0109-7.
Abstract Background: With the onset of next-generation sequencing technologies, we have made great progress in identifying recurrent mutational drivers of cancer. As cancer tissues are now frequently screened for specific sets of mutations, a large amount of samples has become available for analysis.</description>

      <description>Reference Gene Regulatory Network Inference as Relaxed Graph Matching.
Deborah Weighill, Marouen Ben Guebila, Camila Lopes-Ramos, Kimberly Glass, John Quackenbush, John Platig, Rebekka Burkholz.
Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence
doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.23.167999.
Abstract Gene regulatory network inference is instrumental to the discovery of genetic mechanisms driving diverse diseases, including cancer. Here, we present a theoretical framework for PANDA, an established method for gene regulatory network inference. PANDA is based on iterative message passing updates that resemble the gradient descent of an optimization problem, OTTER, which can be interpreted as relaxed inexact graph matching between a gene-gene co-expression and a protein-protein interaction matrix.</description>

Abstract The use of biological networks such as protein-protein interaction and transcriptional regulatory networks is becoming an integral part of biological research in the genomics era. However, these networks are not static, and during phenotypic transitions like disease onset, they can acquire new “communities” of genes that carry out key cellular processes.</description>

      <description>Reference Constructing Gene Regulatory Networks using Epigenetic Data
Abhijeet Rajendra Sonawane, Dawn L. DeMeo, John Quackenbush, Kimberly Glass.
bioRxiv
doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.19.345827.
Abstract The biological processes that drive cellular function can be represented by a complex network of interactions between regulators (transcription factors) and their targets (genes). A cell’s epigenetic state plays an important role in mediating these interactions, primarily by influencing chromatin accessibility. However, effectively leveraging epigenetic information when constructing regulatory networks remains a challenge.</description>

Abstract Gene regulatory network inference allows for the study of transcriptional control to identify the alteration of cellular processes in human diseases. Our group has developed several tools to model a variety of regulatory processes, including transcriptional (PANDA, SPIDER) and post-transcriptional (PUMA) gene regulation, and gene regulation in individual samples (LIONESS).</description>

Abstract Understanding how each person&#39;s unique genotype influences their individual patterns of gene regulation has the potential to improve our understanding of human health and development, and to refine genotype-specific disease risk assessments and treatments. However, the effects of genetic variants are not typically considered when constructing gene regulatory networks, despite the fact that many disease-associated genetic variants are thought to have regulatory effects, including the disruption of transcription factor (TF) binding.</description>

Joseph N. Paulson, Cho-Yi Chen, Camila M. Lopes-Ramos, Marieke L. Kuijjer, John Platig, Abhijeet R. Sonawane, Maud Fagny, Kimberly Glass &amp;amp; John Quackenbush
BMC Bioinformatics
doi.org/10.1186/s12859-017-1847-x.
Abstract Background
Although ultrahigh-throughput RNA-Sequencing has become the dominant technology for genome-wide transcriptional profiling, the vast majority of RNA-Seq studies typically profile only tens of samples, and most analytical pipelines are optimized for these smaller studies.</description>
